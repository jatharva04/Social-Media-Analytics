I've exposed many clubs but this one seems to be the baap of all

Nothing less than 10 targets daily 

Many people have filed cyber complaints, called cops on spot, told these girls they'll be exposed but it continues

How are u still listing them @zomato despite such reviews ?

Exactly same stories posted by hundreds of men but @MumbaiPolice @CPMumbaiPolice seem to be snoozing

These aren't men scamming men in guise of a woman online. These are real women confidently scamming a guy every single day. Some guys did try to report them but then the woman card & they got scared !!! 

MUMBAI : Plz tag folks from CM office who can help

PLEASE SHARE 🙏🙏

This scammer club has got people to post fake reviews after people started calling them out

Drop a review so that more people become aware : The Godfather Club & Lounge g.co/kgs/ygZ1CJd

You can remind them of their deeds on Instagram too : instagram.com/tgf_mumbai?igs…


Happening right under Bandra Police nose but they don't care to investigate even after formal complaints lodged by victims last time I exposed other club

@TOIMumbai @Khanmidday

Formal complaints lodged online. 

Are cyber complaints taken so that they hibernate in the systems @MumbaiPolice ? Does it not look like an organized crime to you or should we believe that you have some special interest in protecting these scammers ?

Reddit_Post,"Title: Someone sent me a cake with ""Farewell"" written on it.. Body: So today my watchman comes and says you have a delivery from zomato.
And I see it's a cake from Merwans and it has ""Farewell"" written on it.

Firstly, there's no reason to have a Farewell cake.
Secondly I asked all my friends and colleagues if they sent it as a prank and they've all denied.


I'm shit scared rn because why would someone send a ""Farewell"" cake. 

On top of that the delivery boy handed the phone to the watchman and a lady spoke to him and told my dad's name and flat number.

Dad has no clue who could it be and why was his name used in the address.

I was home alone when I received the cake.


Am I just being paranoid or should I report this incident ?

Update 1 : As of 9:00 A.M. my mom threw the cake. I contacted the app they want the order ID which I can't produce cos I didn't place the order lol.
Mom also is asking not to go to police cos she doesn't want any other issues.
Will just be vigilant and maybe keep in constant contact with parents whenever they're out.

And I've uploaded the cake photo in one of the comments in case it's not visible pls tell me.
The reason it has cuts is because we checked to see if anything was put inside the cake. 


Update 2 : 6:50 P.M.

It's been 24 hours since I received the cake lol.

But I haven't received any updates from who sent the cake and zomato also hasn't replied to my DM. 

 I'm overthinking this and will try to forget  this incident.
Thanks to everyone who commented and wished for my safety.

If any updates I'll add here. 

Update 3 : No reply from zomato. Nobody messaged or call regarding the cake. Will just bury this for now.
Thanks to everyone for their suggestions/concern. 


Case closed : Recently after multiple e-commerce delivery boys rang the bell we realized that there was an address confusion.

If you cannot pay your delivery people their share then stop doing business and close the company down instead of making your customers pay your delivery partners.

Reddit_Comment,"There are a few reasons Zomato introduced Gold: 

1. To stick you to one platform, theirs
2. To prevent restaurants from delivering directly to you as they would find it difficult to deliver for free but that's a smaller reason

They literally sold it for 1 to 3 rs even 9 rs to move people from Swiggy. 

However, they messed up on the who will pay for deliveries? 
So they are trying a few solutions. 
1. Start a platform fee. And keep pushing customers till they can take it
2. They reduced Distance for Gold to 7 km
3. They have started charging restaurants now to deliver beyond orders of 4+ km. That will get deployed soon. You'll start seeing your favourite restaurants not possible to deliver soon. Charge is 35 rs per order
4. They have started manipulating distances to more than 7 km of your favourite restaurants.

Reddit_Comment,"Correct me if I’m wrong. 

It’s the restaurant that sets prices on Swiggy ? Restaurants surges the price so as not to be underpaid with Swiggy’s discounts. If they have 50% of mrp on the menu in the restaurant, they will have very little profit post discounts. Compared to when they sell in store it comes entirely in their pockets. 

If you see chain restaurants, like mcd, subway, good flippin burgers etc; it’s cheaper to order online. The prices are same online as they are in store, so you get discount on the base price itself. 

Dominos sells their classic style pizza at 99 on Swiggy I think, on Zomato and in stores it’s 49, Swiggy usually has “offers” on dominos.  

Now coming to packaging, I think that’ should be included in the item and not be charged separately. Delivery is just convenience tax at this point.

I don't think dabbawalas can pivot to Swiggy/Zomato style home deliveries, however they can learn a lot from the dabbawalas and implement some ideas to improve their own operations. At the moment they use the direct point to point model, where one delivery boy goes to the restaurant, picks up your food and delivers straight to your home. This is extremely inefficient because this whole operation of 20-40 minutes results in one man delivering one parcel. Even when you order from quite far away, like from Bandra to Versova, it's the same thing.

Maybe a delivery agent can talk more about this, and let us know how many parcels they deliver during their whole shift. ",mumbai,,https://reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1lbwenm/can_mumbai_dabbawalas_beat_swiggy_and_zomato_in/mxwxslv/,Rajagosavi,138,18,0.91,FuckPigeons2025,102

Like seriously, who fuckin talks like that? Every review was from a first time user with no history. And somehow they have glowing reviews for every single item on the menu, even things like coke and sriracha dip, all in that same overenthusiastic, AI-sounding style.

This is not just a few fake reviews. There are easily hundreds. No way this was done manually right? Has to be automated somehow, right? Worst is Zomato has no way to stop it.

When you actually visit the place, it’s terrible. The food is blah, drinks are watered down, the service sucks, staff is rude and the prices are high.

A deep dive into the review reveal a scam of sorts going on. 
There’s a massive and sudden influx of 5* reviews. The reviews are all the same. I mean they are identical, so it’s not the same sentence pasted multiple times. But the language or the general opinion posted is always the same.
They talk about two things in particular 

1. “Ambience” (I hate that this word is common parlance now, if everything has great ambience, nothing has great ambience)
Review will carry some variation of  “great ambience”

2. “Service” again, mostly all 5 🌟 reviews will mention some variation of “Mr/Ms X gave good service”

Nothing about the food or drinks is ever mentioned. No specifics about what was ordered, the quantity, quality, value for money. Nothing.

And there’s a plethora of these reviews for very top rated place.

Second level dive, so with the inquisitive mind I and free time I have, I dug a little deeper.
I checked the profile of these reviewers on Zomato. And they have reviewed random places at random locations. And all the reviews follow the same template.

Most folks don't bother looking into the authenticity of reviews posted about a specific product or service on the internet, their mind is already made up when they see high ratings.

Reddit_Comment,"They have charged VAT on 461, which is 439 (your drink price) plus 5%.

I'm assuming it's 5% added due to Service Charge.

Charging VAT on Service Charge seems incorrect to me, but I'm no tax expert.

However, charging GST on Service Charge is correct. The service charge is levied by the restaurant for the service provided and hence it is liable to pay GST on it.

But even your GST amount seems to be calculated on some erroneous base. This deserves a complaint OP.",mumbai,,https://reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1kqm1f3/beware_chimichuri_marol_overcharges_gst_and_vat/mt9by0b/,kodester99,33,26,0.92,asn0304,6

There's pretty decent outlets which serve salad these days (available on Swiggy). These are not boring raw salad but quite varied and interesting, do try them. 

Btw, I would imagine that Sandwizza ( Santa Cruz) services Andheri, I love their sandwiches and I'm sure you'll like them too.

Lastly I would suggest you figure a way to cook. For example, you could make a sabji on Sunday and keep it in the fridge and try ordering just chapati from outside during weekdays. Interestingly, the other day as I finished a long client meeting and was walking down to the main road I saw a road side stall making hot and fresh chapatis and I bought some takeaway. I just made sabji at home. 

And one more thing. Not sure you like South Indian. It's very easy and quick to make rasam. You could make Rasam on Sunday and for the next few days just keep rice as soon as you get home from work. You can cook boiled potato sabji South Indian style and that hardly takes time and yet tastes amazing..!!",mumbai,,https://reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1gchwgt/hey_i_have_recently_moved_to_mumbai_and_i_am/ltuz3mr/,pakkykk,15,60,0.86,Solid_Story9420,5

2. Speak with neighbour or security guard to connect you with a cook or maharaj.
3. Negotiate with candidates to come once a week and cook, mains + carbs (rice or roti). Cut your own kachumber salad.
4. Buy Tupperware or similar containers, preferably glass with airlock lids (500 ml ideal). Buy per the number of meals you want to save: 1 or 2 meals x no. of days.
5. Cook the meals in advance on a Sunday, and deep freeze. Microwave each portion before eating.

Reddit_Post,"Title: (PSA) My experience with Food Darzee (very bad). Body: I'm normally just a lurker here but I'm hoping enough people see this, so that people considering using Food Darzee's meal plan services can reconsider. 

I've been staying alone at home for the last 14 days. Since I'm working, I don't have the time to go to the market and buy fresh ingredients, so I decided to go with Food Darzee's meal plan. I'd used their services many years ago and I'd really loved it then, so I assumed it would be pretty much the same.

While booking a plan, I was asked to choose from low carb, balanced meal, keto and 1-2 other diet options. I went with low carb because I wanted to lose weight anyways, and to my surprise, I couldn't see or choose the food items that would be on my menu.

I'm currently already seeing a dietician, so I didn't really need the services of the nutritionist they provide. I said this when the nutritionist called me too, but she just kept repeating ""okay sir, but we'll provide a nutritionist for you."" I gave up and said fine.

Turns out, they have an app where if you go into the menu section, one by one manually you have to go through the days and change the meal item for whichever meals you've chosen. I chose breakfast, lunch and dinner, so I sat and manually changed a week's worth of 3 meals a day, which is painfully long. Not only that, there's essentially 2 options they give, one Indian and one non Indian, and only variations in that. For example, some gravy with paneer/tofu/veggies/chicken. And many of these aren't even low carb meals - so what's the point of making me choose when I sign up?

They also changed items I'd chosen without informing me. I asked them again and again to tell me if they're changing items, and the nutritionist said it's because of the calories count. Then why did you give me the option to choose those items in the first place? Did you not plan properly and then give menu options?

Additionally, they put boiled carrots, peas and cauliflower in almost every meal, whether Indian or not. So there have been many days where I've eaten pesto spaghetti with boiled carrots and peas mixed in. I asked them to discontinue carrots and they did, but not without fighting about the calories count (again).

They don't have proper communication with the logistics partner's either. The delivery person they've assigned to me comes almost at the start of the 8 am to 10 am slot they've assigned for deliveries. Till today, in the last 14 days, I can count on one hand how many times he's given me the food in my hands. Almost always, he rings the bell and leaves the food outside my door and leaves. It's still happening, even after I raised the issue with the company and they acknowledged it. Idk if he's in a rush to get back into the lift or what, but why would you just leave food items outside someone's door without checking if they've got it? Even Swiggy and Zomato don't do that.

And then the delivery person randomly decides not to show up to pick up my food from the company. I find out about this an hour before I have to leave for work, which means I have to sit at home until the last possible minute to see if he comes. The alternate delivery person didn't arrive by the time I had to leave, so I informed the nutritionist and asked for that day's food to not be sent, and she agreed. When I went down to my gate, the delivery person was there and was going upstairs. I told his partner to call him back as I was going out, the food would be lying there outside for 6-8 hours and he then did so.

Overall, it's been a pretty basic experience. What I remember of Food Darzee's service from years ago is completely gone. I'd recommend everyone reading this post to NOT use their services, try looking for another one if you need meal plans (and please recommend some if you know and trust any others).

TL;DR: Food Darzee promises one thing and does the exact opposite. You have very little choice of what food you get and they have little to no communication with the logistics partner. You're better off looking for another meal plan company.",mumbai,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1faybf7/psa_my_experience_with_food_darzee_very_bad/,undead-inside,13,13,1,,

Big mistake to come back to these guys.


1. Sending food - Incomplete. Pav Bhaji without Pao. Amazing!
2. Food spillage.
3. Sending low carb food? I got full grain rice in one of meals! Unless your company thinks that Keto is full grain rice now.
4. 50% of the food is absolutely -
TASTELESS!
5. Food has been stale and infact stinky.
6. App is crap. It doesnt follow anything. Initially on deposit it will say prepay for the month and get 1k credit. You will never get it. Not like you will use it anyway.

Reddit_Comment,"Learn to cook, if you can't do that then start eating raw food. I mean eat fresh vegetables and fruits such as apples, orange, watermelon, banana, grapes, papaya, kiwi, etc. Not all vegetables can be eaten raw so get the ones that can be eaten as salads such as carrot, cucumber, beetroot, tomatoes, onions, capsicum, broccoli, lettuce leaves, celery, etc. These veggies provide the daily nourishment needed by the body besides keeping good gut health.

Also start having dairy products such as milk and yoghurt which is good for gut health as well. You can also buy dry fruits such as almonds, pistachios, walnut, pumpkin seeds, dry figs, and dates. You can consume them when you feel like snacking which is a good healthy option. Plus you can buy and keep a crate of eggs so you can have it for breakfast as boiled/omlette/scrambled egg.

For your protein requirement you need to have chicken, fish but since you can't cook so you can try out the local restaurants but don't make it a habit of eating from there daily. Eating from restaurants just once or twice a week would be okay.",mumbai,,https://reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1mmkww0/need_food_hacks/n82ia75/,Weshall50,6,11,0.69,mumbai_guy1,2

Reddit_Post,"Title: Zomato Just Fired Me (and 300+ Others) Without Warning—Here’s the Ugly Truth. Body: I never thought I’d be writing this, but here we are. Today, I was fired from Zomato for what I can only describe as a ridiculous and unfair reason: being late by an average of just 28 minutes over the past three months. No warning, no opportunity to improve—just a cold termination, despite having excellent metrics, a great track record, and a strong presence on the floor.

And I’m not alone. Over 300 employees have been fired under similar circumstances, with Zomato showing zero willingness to listen or give even a single chance for improvement. They didn’t care about the effort we put in, the results we delivered, or the dedication we showed. Just like that, they wiped out hundreds of jobs without a second thought.

This isn’t about a few minutes of lateness—it’s about a company that treats employees as disposable, no matter their contributions. If you’re working at Zomato or thinking of joining, be warned: your hard work means nothing to them when they decide it’s time to cut numbers.

Zomato built its success on the backs of employees who put in real effort, but when it comes to loyalty, they show none in return. Share this if you believe companies should be held accountable for treating employees like numbers instead of people.

It reminds me of the EY death case where the manager is said to have loved to watch cricket.

These managers will enjoy life by attending cricket matches/going for music concert etc.

But, the employees are slaves who have to work 24 x 7 and can be subjected to severe harassment, and even lose their lives!

Now I would have understood if the amount was 200-300 inflated but 1000 bucks is total bs. But at-least zomato offered a free delivery 🥰 ",delhi,,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gfj57t,mrclown005,798,300,0.95,,

Reddit_Post,"Title: Incident that shook me. Body: 
Last night, my brother and I were traveling from Naraina to Rohini by cab at 1 a.m. After crossing the Punjabi Bagh flyover, we heard loud screams near the bus stand. As we moved forward, we found a Zomato rider pinned to the ground, screaming for help. Two guys were beating him while two others sat on their bike, all with their faces covered. He was shouting bachao bachao and seeing all this made me numb. We didn’t stop our car because there were four of them, and they could have been armed. We drove ahead and luckily found a policeman. We quickly explained the situation to him, and he called for backup before heading to the scene.

1% of me is thinking this all could have been a setup to loot the other. Now Im questioning what else we could have done? Should we've stopped the car? Also realised that Aap jitna batman samjhlo khudko if something like this happens thodi der ke liye fatt toh jaati hai.

Reddit_Post,"Title: HELP! First iPhone Got Crushed at Christmas + Last Day to Buy AppleCare+ = Desperate Delhiite . Body: Hey everyone, I'm in a tough spot and could really use some quick advice. My very first iPhone got destroyed tonight in the most unfortunate way and I'm still trying to process what happened.

Was at a friend's Christmas party in Gurgaon. While leaving, a group of 6-7 people came downstairs to see me off. In the chaos of a reversing car and a Zomato delivery guy crossing paths, my phone somehow ended up on the ground. Either got run over or stepped on - happened so fast I couldn't even tell. Worst part? It's my first ever iPhone, and now it's bent with a dead screen.

Current situation:
- Screen is completely black and touch doesn't work
- FaceID surprisingly still works
- Phone rings and receives calls
- Tried screen mirroring on a borrowed Mac but no luck since it wasn't set up before
- Phone is physically bent

Today is my last day to get AppleCare+ and I desperately need some jugaad to handle this situation.

I'm based in Delhi and can travel anywhere in NCR if needed. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any tricks or tips on:
1. Getting AppleCare+ with a damaged phone
2. Places that can fix this quickly (authorized or trusted local shops)

Would really appreciate any help or guidance. Time is super critical here as I only have 24 hours left to figure this out.

Apple care cost around 18000, For the replacement to work you have to pay around 9000 rs as service fees to repair ( Even with apple care ), So in the end you will be paying around 27000.

Burrito Sauce:

THICK CURD  3/4 CUP KETCHUP 2 TBSP RED CHILLI SAUCE  1 TBSP LEMON JUICE | 1 TSP MEXICAN SEASONING 1 TSP GARLIC  4 CLOVES (GRATED)

**Method:**

Add all the powdered spices of the seasoning into a mixer jar & grind it together to make the Mexican seasoning, you can also just add all the spices into a jar or a bowl & mix them. Set a kadhai over high flame, add oil & let it get hot. Add onion, mixed bell peppers, paneer & the remaining ingredients & cook over high flame for 2-3 minutes, the paneer & veggies are ready. Soak ½ cup rajma overnight & then pressure cook for 5 whistles, add water above an inch from the level of rajma & also add one cinnamon stick. Set a kadhai over high flame, add oil & let it get hot, then add onion, garlic & jalapeno/green chilli, stir well & cook over high flame until the onion starts to turn light golden brown. Grate & add the tomato along with Mexican seasoning & salt, stir well & add a splash of hot water & cook over high flame for a couple of minutes. Further add the boiled beans (rajma), stir well & let it come to a boil & then cook until the beans thicken up. Taste & adjust salt if required & the refried beans are ready. Set a wok over high flame, add butter & let it melt. Further add the cooked rice along with, fresh coriander, lemon juice, salt, stir well & cook for 2-3 minutes over high flame & the lemon coriander rice is ready. Add all the ingredients of the pico de gallo into a bowl along with the sweet corn & mix well, pico de gallo is ready. Similarly, add all the ingredients of the sauce into a bowl & mix well to make the burrito sauce. To make the burrito add a layer of rice on a tortilla, then add all the remaining components, make sure you don’t overstuff or else it will be difficult to wrap the burrito. Make sure to keep the fillings toward the middle & not too close to the edges, this will give you room to fold the tortilla properly. Start by folding the left & right sides of the tortilla in towards the center, covering the edges of your fillings, then grab the bottom of the tortilla and fold it up over the fillings, then start rolling the burrito from the bottom, keeping the fillings tucked in, roll it till the top as tight as possible, when you reach the top fold the edges of the tortilla inwards & close it. Toast it over a hot pan or skillet until it turns light golden brown from 2 sides & your delicious veg paneer burrito is ready. To make the burrito bowl just add all the components of the burrito into a bowl one after the other & drizzle some burrito sauce from the top.",delhi,,https://reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1gonbpc/made_myself_burrito_bowl_last_night/lwk0ofj/,rajeevvijay,259,34,0.99,rajeevvijay,14

Reddit_Post,"Title: Only Zomato Customers Can Hurt Them Most—500+ Fired, Stop Ordering NOW!"". Body: Hey Reddit, listen up—Zomato’s turned into the bad guy we all hate. They just fired 500+ employees without a warning, like tossing out old food. No notice, no care, just “get out.” And guess what? They’re not even broke—they’ve got money to burn, opening District and Bistro while kicking their workers to the curb. Loyalty? To Zomato, it’s a joke they don’t get.

It gets worse. The jobs they cut? Already back up for grabs, like nothing happened. Promises to their team? Thrown away like stale bread. The government’s asleep, the law’s useless, and these fired folks are stuck. Who’s left to save the day? You, Zomato customers—you’re our only shot!
We’ve all snapped at the delivery guy for a late order, but he’s not the problem. Zomato’s the one stirring up this mess, serving greed on a platter. So, what do we do? Easy—stop ordering. Hit them where it hurts: their money. Every order you skip is a punch they can’t dodge.

Zomato thinks they’re untouchable, but we’ve got the real power. Delete the app, boycott their food, and let’s save ourselves from this mess. Who’s in? Let’s make Zomato feel the heat!

If you truly care about employees facing difficulties—then take a stand! Share, comment, and let your voice be heard.

Flipkart with fake products and shitty afterservices, Zepto with fake prices and terrible customer service, blinkit,zomato,swiggy with ever increasing prices and terrible subscription models. 

They’re using the tried and tested method of giving their customers an amazing experience in the beginning so they get addicted to using it and then slowly taking away the sweets hoping the addict would still buy their product because they cannot help it. And it is working

Like they started with unlimited range free delivery, which became 10 at first and now 7. No minimum price on order, changed it to 49 then 100 then 149 then 199.
Easy refunds, which have now turned to a lot of hoop jumping with no resolution. 

And best is slowly increasing overhead charges. Customer is like 3 Rs me kya hai de do. Then 5rs me kya he de do, now its 11.80 rs per order. They also very cleverly add insane charges to packaging- 50-60Rs sometimes as packaging charges. Its all becoming a shitshow now.

Even Flipkart has platform fees now. And replace and return options have become terrible. Someone ordered a laptop which was faulty. FLIPKART SAID THERES NO REPLACE OPTION BUT NOW IT IS REPAIR. And you have to go to a service centre yourself to get your brand new laptop fixed. Wtf

The sale days are sham and products are just listed at low price without any intention to deliver them. Even if they deliver either they are defective or not worth it. So now I have stopped looking for things on sale. 

If I have to get a clothing, I just go to the store and try it and buy from them irrespective of whether they are providing sale or not. The thing is I don't want to own a lot of things just a few pieces of fine clothing and also I am not afraid to repeat them. Repeating clothes is something that women try to avoid.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Ultimate Zomato Hack!. Body: You might have seen many a times that Swiggy and Zomato will never let you connect with a customer support agent or simply deny you a refund if your order is spilled, incorrect, has missing items or stuck in a different space-time dimension where the driver has been reaching you in 20 mins for the last 1 hour.



Simple hack: Always choose cash on delivery. It will prioritise your order above gold customers, if you tell their chatbot that you won’t pay if the order is delayed beyond a point they will immediately connect you to a human AND if your order has missing/wrong items - you can simply refuse to pay.


The user experience remains exactly the same - once the order is delivered you can pay via any UPI app or wallet or saved card through the app but you never again have to worry about being Zomato’s starving hostage.

Edit: Wait! To be clear - I’m not suggesting to using this to deny payment of legitimate delivery orders.

Reddit_Post,"Title: True cost of ordering from Zomato based on two recent orders. Body: Since zomato has started charging high platform fee and a bunch of other fees along with end of discounts in most restaurants I see that even the most basic order ends up being north of 200 for one person.

So recently I decided that I would just go to the restaurant and get takeaway. Here are the two cases:

Breakfast from Babai Tiffins: Dosa and Idli. Zomato cost with free delivery 258 rupees. Getting from restaurant 182 rupees. Zomato charges 10 rupees platform fee and GST on it. The item prices are inflated by 20-30%. I found that even packaging fees are inflated on Zomato. The inflated menu prices do not include GST. All said and done I would have paid 66 rupees extra even after having zomato gold. That is 36% higher.

Glen's Bakehouse: Croissant Donuts etc. The bakery had no packaging fees and their menu prices included the GST. I ended up paying 332. On zomato the same items cost 437. Menu prices are higher by 17-18%. Then there is packaging fees which you don't have to pay if you order at the restaurant. You get same packaging though. Add handling fee on top of that and you have the difference of 107 or 32% in this case. Btw, packaging fees scales with order amount. So effectively it is an up charge.

Even with free delivery and relatively larger order size you end up paying 30-40% extra on Zomato.

ZOMATO only makes sense if there is a discount offer on the restaurant which has become so rare nowadays. If you're ordering for one then you have to order more than you normally would to reduce delivery charge or get free delivery if you have zomato gold.

I am lucky enough that I live close to so many good restaurants and I can get there in 5 minutes on bike. Glen's took no time but I had to wait for Dosa a little as it was Sunday morning and the place was crowded due to high demand.

This brings me to another service restaurants can provide. Order online only for pickup. That would eliminate the occasional wait times. When zomato and swiggy were giving huge discounts it didn't make sense as you could always order for cheaper than picking up at the restaurant but now there is a huge gap and unless restaurants start charging handling fee on that too, they just might since a lot of restaurants charge packaging fee even though takeaways are cheaper for restaurants than dine in customers.

While on this topic, I also noticed that ""10 minute grocery delivery"" apps are now asking for ""surcharge"" fee during ""high-demand"" hours. My point is that if 10 minute delivery was the business model all along, then why ask now for surcharge during high demand hours? On top of that its not like they will take the surcharge and deliver it within 10 mins, they would still take whatever time it needs to deliver, so in that case why did they even ask customers to pay extra?

Reddit_Comment,"I think the human aspect  is missing in the above analysis -

They charge surges and other fees because customers are willing to pay them.

It makes more sense to order during Diwali instead of being stuck in traffic or missing quality time with friends and family. That is a 30% to 40% increase in perceived time costs. 

During standard days, especially for families with young kids and working couples and elders at the place, getting grocery planning right every day is not feasible. Let's not forget so many things are happening in kids, like your life and everywhere around us. Hence, quick commerce flourishes. 

In tier 1 and 2, city traffic is cruel. Or maybe it is bad weather, either rain or too much heat or humidity, urgent deliverables, other commitments, month-end closing, or more. We all relate to that. 

Some folks might feel lazy and pay extra fees or other charges, or others may use them as a tip to the delivery guy—so many variations and needs.

What’s surprising is, they didn’t seem to provide menus to anyone. Had some excuse that they had run out of menus at night or something like that. We ordered a half chicken tikka biryani, and peri peri fried chicken. The waiter ofc didn’t reveal the prices and we didn’t bother to ask, since the prices on swiggy were usually quite cheap. The waiter tried to upsell the order by asking for salad, soup etc. Mind you, he didn’t say green salad but tried to sell it off as complimentary onions along with biryani.

When the bill came the total amount was : 1029 INR

Breakdown: 

Peri peri chicken (easy bites)4 PC - 419 INR
Half chicken tikka biryani - 499 INR
Green Salad - 62 INR

Taxes n roundoff - 49 INR

Throughout my time in Bangalore I’ve never had such a terrible and ridiculously overpriced biryani. I was able to click a picture of the bill but the waiter didn’t let us keep the final bill. Never visiting that place back again.

I recently moved to Kasavanhalli near Amrita College Road and even this road is jammed every morning extending from the traffic jam in Sarjapur road. Commuting in this area is such a headache, taking minimum 40 minutes to travel just 3 kms. After facing the traffic woes, I decided to walk everyday to office situated in Sarjapur road 3 kms from home, and that was even worse. Though I reached office much faster, it is nothing short of an adventure. Pedestrian footpaths just don't exist here, and if they exist, they are used by the two-wheelers or occupied by the vendors or parking vehicles. In many places, footpaths are broken having open drains underneath. Sometimes pedestrians don't have a way ahead as the whole road is occupied by vehicles and there is no space to walk. These swiggy zomato guys also always ride their yulus like they are gonna run over you. And on top of that had to cross through the dust flying all around in the air, vehicle smoke, a open dumpyard right on the middle of the road and the stinking Kaikondrahalli lake. This area also gets inundated whenever it rains for more than 30 mins. Rents in this area are also sky high.

feedback from porter bike delivery boys - 

1. Porter forcing boys to accept orders whether it's long or short distance or not interested to attend order.
2. Porter is taking work as SLAVE, their policy / terms are not friendly for delivery boys.
3. Porter suspension ID for a few hours or a day if do not accept orders or they put delay 10 seconds to accept orders which will be difficult to accept new orders.
4. This is kind of logistic bike delivery, but porter is taking work as ON FOOT delivery from boys, like - Zomato, amazon. Porter is not paying for ON FOOT delivery charges so why has to go 5th floor or any floor..

Reddit_Comment,"Except for the 5th point, the rest of the stuff doesn't seem illegal in anyway. 

The reason Uber and Ola are becoming problematic is because drivers choose to opt out of going to certain locations for a variety of reasons, some legitimate and some asinine. This eventually hampers the service as a whole as the drivers seem to be the ones making the terms on where they want to go and when they want to do it.

Even your point on not going to the 5th floor to complete an order simply because you're not paid extra for it is misplaced in a highly competitive market.

The guy who was in the back touched her hair, drove away and made some signs and comments at her! I coudnt catch the plates nor I have a dash cam right now.

Byrathi is infested with lowlife criminal gangs. There are thugs, murderers rapists in the making there. I've seen three disturbing incidents like this in that place, in one of which I was a victim. I was lucky to walk out of the situation that day! 

I've observed that most of these guys are young barely 18 and few in their 20s. They work for rapido, swiggy, zomato, auto driver jobs, deliver water cans to society homes and other similar jobs. They have no number plates on their vehicles as well.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Some experiences in Bangalore that shook me and some that touched my heart. Body: I will just post a compilation of both heartwarming as well as negative interactions I had in Bangalore over the past few days working as a Zomato delivery partner.   
(Pardon my grammar and narration style for any mistakes or inconsistencies)

I was mired in some deep personal issues relating to divorce and lots other and had to quit job back in March. (Big time regret). Now I am unable to get any opportunities and hence decided to join Zomato to earn a livelihood until i land a decent job. here are some of the experiences that hurt me and some that touched me:

 **1. The rude lady**: After picking my order from the restaurant, I reached the location on time and reached the customers doorstep. There was no response even after ringing the bell. So I gave her a call and she started yelling at me for being in the wrong location. She called me ""incompetent"" and told me that I cannot even do a simple job like delivery.  
My English had a slight accent as well and she picked it mid way and passively mocking my accent with someone in the background as I pronounced it as ""dɪˈlɪv(ə)ri"" and she started highlighting it to her friend saying the ""the dɪˈlɪv(ə)ri person couldn't find the location"" and all. Somehow mentioned the location as a parlour and I made my way to there which was 1.5km from her given location.

Apparently she ordered some drinks to parlour but ended up ordering it to her home address. I didnt reason with her much, but just let her know what had apparently happened. She just told it might have been an app issue and left. No sorry, nothing. I exchanged a friendly smile and left.

**2.** **The chain snatch incident**: On my way to pick up an order, a cow jumped in front of me from my blind spot and in order to avoid a collision, I tried evading and fell on the road. Luckily the speed wasn't much, but i ended up bruising my knees and feet badly. My feet got stuck in the wheel alloy and from that day I am limping. A few people who were standing in the roadside were quick to respond, helped me up and parked my bike on the side. Those were some genuinely good people. 

I was so pissed off that people are letting their cattle loose on a highway but suddenly I felt it. Someone was trying to pull mu gold chain. My chain was tangled with the waterproof mobile pouch which I was wearing across my neck and as the person pulled it, i could quickly feel my phone lift up a bit. I immediately held my chain and looked back unable to figure who it was since there were a lot of people assembled around me. I was bleeding, I was in pain, I was high on adrenaline, but this incident really shook me. I swiftly took off and left the place en-route collect my next order.

**3.** **The very kind security person**: It was raining badly and I wasn't getting any orders. SO i thought to settle and await an order in a fast paced food spot. There were quite some restaurants there very adjacent to each other. I parked my vehicle and was limping to shelter and this old man saw me limping from a distance. He ran all the way to me and told me not to strain much, just let him know the order number and he will collect it on behalf of me.

I was so touched by the kind gesture of this man. I let him know that I haven't had any order yet and was just heading for a tea. I was feeling so overwhelmed my this kind gesture. 

4. **A mean bunch**: I reached the drop location and called the person and they let me know that they resided in the 5th floor. I looked up to see that they waved their hands to come to the top. I was limping, but in no way I was slow. I limped all the way to the top and i could hear the ladies talking in Malayalam where once girl was asking the other in Malayalam if that Limp legged Ma\*\*\*\*(cuss word in malayalam) hasn't come yet and the other person replied back to her saying that by the time that Ma\*\*\*\*(cuss word in Malayalam), it will be night.  
In no way I was slow. I was walking in the same pace as any normal human do. I felt bad, but this is how it is. Everyone was things so fast these days. I immediately showed up and suddenly it dawned on them that i might have heard them. I pretended as if I dint understand their language, proceeded to exchange a casual smile, handed their package and left.

5. **An angel of a lady**: I was heading to a delivery and as I crossed the road, I saw an old man with a walking stick struggling to put his chappal on. I without any hesitation bend down and helped him with it. He gratuitously told something in Kannada (which i didn't understand at all, but it made me feel happy).   
I proceeded to the 1st floor for the delivery where this lady was already standing in the corridor to collect the order. She collected the older and told me that i was a very good man. Apparently she she saw me helping the old man. I thanked her for being so nice and she invited me for a lunch. I lied to her saying that I did had my lunch just now only and thanked her for her benevolent gesture. Still she gave me some lime water and asked if I need anything else for my travel like snacks and all. I again lied to her that I am finishing my shift and left.

Her beautiful smile stayed with me. A lot of people has been mean to me in different ways, but never have my eyes turned wet. But now I as I drove to the next pickup location, I felt warm drops of tears rolling down my cheecks. Guess I could take all the hate in this world, But I am not used to getting love or people being nice to me.

6. **A very chill and open-minded guy**: It was late in the evening. My phone was already running out of charge. So as I reached a customer location, I asked the person if he could plug in my phone for charge for a good 5 minutes. This guy agreed and he invited me into his place. I told him i was good standing outside, but he insisted, made me sit, offer some water and before leaving even offered me that sweet peanut candy.  
I left that place with a feeling of warmth and happiness in my heart.

7. **The entitled lady**: I had a delivery at  facility which I believe was some sort of quarters or hostel facility for medical students/Doctors. The security wasn't allowing delivery person inside and asked me to call the concerned person. I called the person and waited for a good 10 minutes. It also started drizzling lightly. It was already 10 mins, I followed up again with a call to see that her phone was busy. I tried again to get shouted at asking why cant you wait a bit?

Now the drizzle has turned into a full blown rain and that too subsided after 5 mins back to a drizzle. Now this lady stepped out from the facility. Now it was nearing 20 mins. Guess  I should have reported to customer care already, but I gave her a call again. I realised that she was the one who exited the facility now and she is stalling talking to someone while making me wait in this cold rain. Again after a few minutes once she finished the call, she came and picked up my order.

No excuses for stalling, no apologies, not even an acknowledgement. Came and collected the package as if the entire purpose of my birth was to wait for her and then left just like that.

These experiences has really been a life-changer for me. They have really taught me a lot and reminded me of how good my life was when i just worked on weekdays in an A/C cabin with full blown facilities. I c consider each and every experience as a precious gem that is molding and shaping me into a better person with grit and resilience. 

But deep down I still wish the world would have been a better place with more nice people in it.",bangalore,,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1mndagr/some_experiences_in_bangalore_that_shook_me_and/,anantharamashok,195,16,0.95,,

I've worked jobs similar-ish/like this back when I was in my late teens so I know how harsh some of these people can be (which also tells me how calm you must be to be able to bite your tongue even when people are unnecessarily rude and callous). One of the things that has stayed with me cus of it perhaps, is that, everytime I have a delivery person over I always ask them if they would like water or food. Most refuse, but I know how rough these things can be.

Reddit_Post,"Title: People feeling harassed due to their commute and behavior of auto mafia, why not purchase a bike? Some details inside.. Body: You can purchase a splendor plus for 1 lakh rupees. If you take a loan you will be paying around 3k per month for 3 years. End of that you get to keep the bike. The bike will also give you a good mileage of 50-60 kilometers per liter even in Bangalore traffic.

Assume you have to go to office 3 times a week. That is 24 rides a month. If your office is 6-7 kilometers away it is at least 150 rupees a trip. That itself is 3600 rupees per month. But Auto drivers also expect inflated fare and except in low traffic periods you would probably be paying 200-300 per ride. Apart from that going out to meet friends and family, going out to grab a quick bite in your neighborhood instead of ordering from zomato/swiggy will be pretty much free.

Having ridden many bikes splendor is a great bike. It is lightweight, it is smooth with the most refined engine, any mechanic can fix it for you if it ever broke. Yes, it is not sexy but just think of not having to argue with auto drivers, not having to wait for 15 minutes and be late to your appointments and waste your time as well as other people's time.

For ladies and those not comfortable with bikes activa is also a very similar option though with lower mileage.

Happy to answer questions and give advice if you want to purchase a bike.

The customer support executive then went on to defend him throughout the conversation and support all his lies, he even verified his number in front of her but she says the last two numbers were interchanged. Now how is that my fault?
I was given a stupid coupon of 119 and fed a load of sweet talk about how Zomato cares for their customer and she’s here to “sort this out” and I should “have patience” and “calm down” and “relax”. 
Like okay Ma’am then recognise your customer is not the one who cancelled the order and got a free mutton biryani? 
Knowing all the scams going on and to shamelessly defend the delivery guy and blame the customer is a new low for anyone.

There's just too many customers for some restaurants and there's only limited supply of pure cheese, paneer , oil or special items.
There's no fucking way they can get fresh, pure unadulterated food ingredients at that volume.

To make things worse, he continued to call her the next day despite her telling him to stop. Not only did she have to endure this harassment, but she also lost her money because the order never arrived, and no refund was offered.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Lack of contact number for Zomato for reporting theft by their executive. Body: A zomato delivery executive who came to deliver to my neighbors flat during 9th Midnight, around 12 AM stole my shoes. He wore my Nike Shoes amd left leaving his chappals in front of my flat. 

I had got the details of the executive and CCTV visuals. The alarming thing is there is no number to reach out to Zomato to report such issues. This is a company that has crores in income and could not spend a bit of it to setup a call center to handle such grievances? I had to drop an email and wait for their executive to reach out to me.

I went to nearest police station to report this but since there was no contact to reach to Zomato, i had to come back. The constable has assured to drop email from official email of police if I am not receiving any response by tomorrow noon.

I understand that things like these woukd happen, but what I am surprised is the lack of a open communication line through phone for this. This is not acceptable being a giant in food delivery business and things like these happen.

Anyway I will see where this is going. I am worried about other thefts that these delivery executives ( i am not pointing all, but the ones who does this) has done and people has left this midway due to the lack of support from zomato.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Magic Pin... Not so magic. Body: Long post alert!!!

So this happened a couple of days back. My husband had placed an order at Connie's steak house through the Magic Pin app. After almost 45 minutes of wait, we realise the delivery partner (let's call him A) assigned, has now been changed and we have a new person (B) assigned. 

By now, it's almost an hour of wait since placing the order, so we called up the delivery partner and B tells us that he's almost at the restaurant and it's not his fault that magic pin messed up with the delivery partner assignment earlier (he just got assigned to the job, so as to speak). We kindly told him we understand, just wanted to get to know what's actually happening at the ground, and got off the call. Note in all this mess, we have no way to contact the magic pin customer care.

Few minutes later B called us back saying the restaurant is actually not positioned at the point where it's shown on the map. To get to the actual place, he would have to go a further 2 kms and also, it's on the other side of the road. We contacted the restaurant and they confirmed what B said. According to them they had moved, and their new location has been updated on Swiggy and Zomato, Magic Pin is yet to do the same. However, when we told about the extra 2km charge that B had complained (50 rupees), they offered to compensate that amount directly to B for all the trouble, and this information was accordingly conveyed by us to B. 

Few minutes later, we get a notification from the Magic Pin app that our order has been cancelled and our money has now been fully refunded. Frustrated and hungry, we call up B to understand what's going on and he tells us that he has already picked up the order (and the 50rs. promised for the extra kms), and is on his way to deliver it to our location (according to him, in his own words, he has picked it up from the restaurant, so restaurant can't do anything now, neither can he, because he has the food in his hand, so he told us not to bother about what Magic Pin has done). 

Another 20 minutes go by and B is at our doorstep with the order. He told my husband that Magic Pin does cancel out orders at times when the delivery time takes too long (in this case, being assigned from A to B and all the extra distance confusion and such), or something of that sort. He casually asked my husband the price of the order and he blurted out that it was about 1k. Just before leaving our doorstep, B casually added, there are chances Magic Pin might try to take a ""penalty from him for late/delayed delivery"". So this is where we realised how the whole game's now gonna enfold. Immediately, I warned my husband that in a few days time, B, even though he had portrayed himself as the nice guy and delivered our order post cancellation, take  he's now gonna target us for that 1k my husband accidentally blurted out.

True to my words, B contacted my husband from another number today (my husband had blocked the original number out of fear of being annoyed by this guy in future), claiming magic pin has fined him for 900 bucks and he would like that money from us. We have no problem with the money part, we don't believe in having anything for free, but as long as it's not being paid to the platform or the restaurant (both of which have not approached us), we don't feel comfortable with B saying his penalty is for 900 rupees. We don't support lying or cheating, and we do know his penalty can't be as expensive as our order.

What should we do in this situation, as even if we block him, he could come up to our house and threaten us (true we have security and our society uses MyGate for entries and exits, but he could enter the society under the pretext of delivering an order in some other apartment). Has anyone ever faced something like this through Magic Pin?",bangalore,,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1ii45l4/magic_pin_not_so_magic/,Tall-Tree2792,34,33,0.84,,

Reddit_Post,"Title: Is zepto cafe hygienic?. Body: There was a Zepto dark store near our place that didn’t appear well-maintained. When Zepto Cafe started, we asked a delivery partner if the food for Zepto Cafe orders was prepared there, and he confirmed it was. Over the following days, I heard excellent reviews about Zepto Cafe, so I decided to try it myself. To my surprise, the food was impressive — the packaging, taste, and quality were all excellent.

However, this raises a question: is the food preparation area truly hygienic? Based on the condition of the dark store I saw, it didn’t seem very clean. Many cloud kitchens run by Zomato or Swiggy have been criticized for poor hygiene, yet there doesn’t seem to be much discussion about Zepto Cafe. Why is that?

Reddit_Post,"Title: Farewell, Pune: Where Love, Growth, and Music Shaped My Soul♥️. Body: Today, I say goodbye to Pune—a city that has been much more than just a place on the map. It’s been my home, my launchpad, and the canvas upon which I painted some of the most transformative chapters of my life.

When I first arrived here, I was stepping into the unknown. I started my career living independently, carrying with me a mix of excitement and trepidation. I had little more than dreams and determination, and I didn’t know a single soul in this sprawling city. Yet, Pune welcomed me with open arms, and slowly but surely, it became my sanctuary.

These 2.5 years have been a whirlwind of growth, heartbreak, and rediscovery. I lost the love of my life when I moved here—a loss that shattered me—but in the midst of that pain, I found love again in unexpected ways. I discovered strength I never knew I had, and with every setback, I grew wiser and more resilient. From the challenges of carving out a career to nurturing my mental well-being, Pune has seen me at my best and my worst, and I am forever grateful for every experience.

I evolved in ways I never imagined. I went from being an amateur cook, barely daring to experiment in the kitchen, to honing my skills as a professional chef. Each dish I prepared was a testament to my journey—a blend of passion, experimentation, and growth. Along the way, I built a safe space, a haven where I could be unapologetically myself. 

Some of my most cherished memories are as simple as watching the planes land and take off across from the runway—each arrival and departure a reminder of life’s constant motion. I nurtured my plant babies, watching them grow and thrive undehr my care. My adventures in Pune were as diverse as they were exhilarating: joining book clubs, cafe hopping—with countless visits to Dohiti(my favorite cafe), bar hopping, and creating endless concert memories that still echo in my heart. The energy of those live shows, the electrifying atmosphere, and the shared passion of music turned strangers into friends and made every concert night unforgettable.

And who could forget those crazy, unforgettable house parties, drunken night strolls, midnight munchies, and the savior services of Zomato, Swiggy, and Zepto that punctuated many of my nights? Each moment, each adventure, has woven together into a tapestry of memories that define my time here. 

Most importantly, I found my people here—friends who became my chosen family. I came to Pune a stranger, but I leave with a community of incredible souls who shared in my joys, my struggles, and my triumphs. You all helped shape me into the person I am today, and for that, I will be eternally grateful.

As I bid farewell to this chapter, I carry with me every lesson, every laugh, every tear, and every memory. Pune, you were incredible. Thank you for the growth, the love, and the countless moments that will forever live in my heart.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Title: Zomato Delivery Guy Tried to Make Me Pay Extra.. Body: 
I wanted to share an incident from yesterday. I ordered burgers from burger king through Zomato, which was around 540 rupees which I had already paid through google pay. The delivery was supposed to arrive in 30 minutes, but it came 1 hour late🥱

When the delivery boy saw me (a girl), he said, ""Madam, ₹50 extra hoga kyunki aapka order door se aaya hai"" (you’ll need to pay ₹50 extra because your order came from far away). I knew this wasn’t right and asked him to check again. He was about to insist when my elder brother came up from behind and asked him, What’s the issue?

The moment the delivery boy saw him, he quietly left without saying anything further. It was obvious he thought that  he could trick me. This is a reminder to stay aware and never pay extra money unless it’s officially stated by the platform. Late delivery or distance is not the customer’s responsibility, and scammers might try to exploit such situations. 🤧🤧

Reddit_Post,"Title: Zomato Delivered Chicken Instead of Paneer from Rolls Mania – My Vegetarian Friend Ended Up Vomiting. No Real Support From Them.. Body: I'm absolutely livid and disgusted right now. We ordered a Paneer Roll via Zomato from Rolls Mania, and they ended up sending a Chicken Roll instead. My friend, a lifelong strict vegetarian, took a bite assuming it was paneer. Within seconds, he realized something was off — we opened it and were horrified to find it was chicken.

He immediately started vomiting. Imagine someone who’s never eaten meat in their life — who follows vegetarianism for religious and ethical reasons — unknowingly biting into flesh. This isn't just a wrong order, it’s a disgusting and traumatic violation of trust and belief.

And guess what?

Zomato’s in-app support is a joke — only automated messages, no real human interaction.

Tried calling the number listed for Rolls Mania on Zomato — it’s non-existent.

No way to escalate. No ownership. No response. No accountability.


How is this acceptable in 2025? What if my friend had a severe allergy? What if someone with religious restrictions was served meat without consent? Where’s the basic food safety and responsibility?

This is not some minor complaint. This is gross negligence from both Rolls Mania and Zomato.

Zomato — is this how you treat your customers? How can you allow restaurants to operate on your platform without even verifying contact details or ensuring food accuracy?

We're looking at options to take this up legally. If anyone here has dealt with something similar or knows the right channels to escalate this, please guide us.

This isn’t just about one meal — it’s about accountability, ethics, and respect for customers’ choices and beliefs.

Reddit_Comment,"Ideally, both Rolls Mania and Zomato are partially responsible, but it's not possible for Zomato to be 100 percent sure what roll is inside the packet. 

Also, I think if your friend is extremely particular about not having meat,- they shouldn't order from restaurants that sell it + check the meal once before consuming. Your argument about the food allergy thing doesn't really stand. People with food allergies should triple check. 

I don't like the smell of mutton and would find it unpleasant if I were to get a mutton roll instead of a chicken roll. Hence, I would obviously check the food once by unwrapping the wrap/ turning the biryani to check the meat piece,- before consuming.",pune,,https://reddit.com/r/pune/comments/1jw54b9/zomato_delivered_chicken_instead_of_paneer_from/mmhnzkf/,vairarchi,154,99,0.77,schrodingerdoc,30

I’m on the hunt for some amazing North Indian non-veg food and would love your recommendations. I’m looking for places that offer:

2. Dine-in experiences



Preferably in these areas:

Koregaon Park

Kalyani Nagar

Viman Nagar

Kharadi

Hadapsar


Would appreciate suggestions for both budget-friendly and slightly premium options. Bonus points for places known for their butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, kebabs, or biryanis!

Reddit_Post,"Title: Reviving the Ride: A Heartwarming Tale of Exceptional Service by Jawa Motorcycles. Body: We’ve all seen it—social media often amplifies the negative. One harsh comment or critical review about a brand can outstand the good. I come from a service background, so I know this too well: out of ten glowing positives, it’s that one negative that grabs the spotlight. Take Zepto or Zomato, for instance—their on-ground teams hustle to deliver your order in record time, yet a single slip-up can spark a storm of complaints. It’s human nature, I suppose. But today, I want to flip the script and share something that deserves to be heard—a story of exceptional service from Jawa Motorcycles that left me genuinely impressed.I own a Jawa 350, the stunning orange model—it’s my pride and joy. But life got in the way. For two months, it sat idle in my parking lot in Pune, thanks to relentless work travel. Last week, as I eased back into my routine, I decided it was time to take it for a spin to work. Deep down, I knew it wouldn’t start—two months of neglect will do that to any bike. Sure enough, the engine didn’t even sputter. I rolled it to a nearby garage, hoping for a quick fix, but the price they quoted felt like highway robbery.Frustrated, I thought, “This isn’t right. There’s got to be a better way.”That’s when I reached out to Jawa’s customer care. I wasn’t expecting much—just a number to call or a “visit the showroom” response. But within ten minutes, my phone rang. It was a team member from a branded Jawa service centre in Pune. “Sir, if your bike isn’t starting, don’t worry—we’ll come pick it up from your home.” I was floored. It was a Sunday, mind you—a day when most places would rather push you to Monday. Yet, within a couple of hours, two guys in Jawa uniforms were at my doorstep, cheerfully loading my 350 onto their pickup vehicle. No fuss, no judgment about my bike’s dusty state—just pure professionalism.An hour later, my phone buzzed with a WhatsApp message, followed by a call. They’d checked the bike, listed the issues (battery drain, a minor oil leak, the usual suspects), and gave me a rough cost estimate. Yes, there was a pickup charge, but honestly, it felt fair for the convenience. What blew me away was how they kept me in the loop—clear, transparent, and quick. By late evening, I heard the familiar rumble of my Jawa 350 pulling up. There it was, back at my doorstep, gleaming and purring like it had never taken a two-month nap.What stood out wasn’t just the service itself—it was the care. They answered my dumbest questions (“Will it start tomorrow morning?”) with patience and a smile. They were proactive, reachable, and genuinely customer-first. In a world where negativity often steals the show, this experience reminded me that there’s plenty of good out there—sometimes it just needs a louder voice. So here’s mine: kudos to the Jawa service team in Pune for turning a stalled bike into a story worth sharing.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Its Depressing to see where India is headed. Body: _This post is a rant_

_“If you have the resources to leave India, please leave.”_

This is something I hear a lot from people. It's disheartening because I love my country, but I'm really worried about where we're headed. While we do have a better purchasing power, UPI systems, cheap labor, and conveniences like Swiggy and Zomato, it feels like we're missing the bigger picture.

What scares me most is our huge youth population. By 2030, we could've utilized this, but instead, there's a focus on religion and cultural superiority. Criticism isn't taken well, and there's a tendency to take credit for the success of a few, like Sundar Pichai or Satya Nadella, who left for better opportunities.

I worry that we don't embrace criticism, and our youth are either obsessed with UPSC or is jobless or stuck in deeply unsatisfying toxic work culture. The quality of jobs, especially in mass recruitment sectors, is concerning. There aren't enough startups or government support to build things. 

I love my country, but I'm scared of what lies ahead, especially if this mindset persists. It worries me and I just wanted a place to express it. Thanks",india,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hyqglz/its_depressing_to_see_where_india_is_headed/,ziggyboom30,3021,476,0.92,,

Reddit_Post,"Title: Amazon India has introduced a ₹5 “Marketplace Fee” per order.. Body: Even on Prime. Even for low-value items. What exactly are we paying for?

* This isn’t packaging.
* It’s not shipping.

Sellers already pay logistics fees, storage fees, return penalties, ad costs. Now the buyer is being taxed too, just for placing an order? Isn't it a breach of contract for sellers or buyers already enrolled in Prime? Or can we do nothing but to look for replacements? What actual good replacements are out there because Flipkart is just an evil twin of Amazon already!

It’s not about ₹5. It’s about how decisions like these made quietly, affect sellers’ margins, customer trust, and platform loyalty. Swiggy and Zomato started with Rs 2, moved up to 10. Then the government got greedy and wanted tax on it as well. So we now stand at 11.8 Platform fee for both Swiggy and Zomato. Flipkart has all sorts of fees, platform fee, open box fee, shagun ka lifafa for delivery person and whatnot nonsense!

**Is this a signal to move back to the local shops? Or is it just a sign and consequence of maturing market forces?**

EDIT: As suggested by Mods, here's the proof from Amazon FAQ: [https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TF3RSudjie3qn1Q5y9](https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TF3RSudjie3qn1Q5y9)

PS: If this is not common knowledge yet, Amazon is also charging a flat Rs 49 discount fee now. So if you buy an item worth 10k, get 10% discount on your SBI card on sales, but then return the item because its not as expected, the discount fee will still have to be paid. 

PPS: I know this is a corporate strategy. Amazon is well within its rights to first sideline the local shop competition by providing discounts, and then establish a monopoly. It is natural and expected. The point of this post is that we, as consumers, must also counter strategize, right? Actions must have reactions. A duopoly is in Amazon's benefit, not ours. Least we can do is make a point against irrational practices. For example, Zepto applies so many hidden charges that there is a thin line between placing an order and getting scammed. Most e-commerce platforms seem to be moving that way. If Amazon needs more money,  increase the price of Prime by 100 bucks, I think hardly anyone will notice. But this practice of some surcharge here some there is, atleast for me, in bad taste. This is designed to entrap unsuspecting customers, not to charge genuine value.

1. Today I had issues with Airtel network, it's extremely hard to speak to human. They say unlimited 5g but when spoken to support team they say ""that's fake, it's just a marketing gimmick"" (literal same words)

2. I need to contact insurances companies more than 20 times to get reimbursement, they just resolve the tickets without resolution... its very frustrating to explain everything to new agent from starting.

3. The highways are bad in my place, when complained about it there's no action. and we are fucking taxed.

4. Myntra delivered me wrong order (serial number mismatch), after 25+ calls I was able to raise complaint. Every customer support associate just puts me on hold and ends the call when the issue is complicated.

5. Zomato delivered half portion food, and when complained they say "" We cannot reach out to restaurant  verify this claim, hence we wont refund"" (they call restaurant at 3:34 am )

6. Amazon support team never understand the issue, they put me on hold and ends the call. I get resolution only when I escalate. 

  
I never...ever cheated or did any fraud with any of the company to get compensation or refund.

I know a lot of people put fake claims to get refund/replacement and this impacts legible customers also. 

I just hate to be in India now, there's no support for the services we pay for. India has no strict regulations or something.

I'd start ordering stuff for friends and family more often because of my new-found comfort of believing that I was saving a bit each time I ordered. After all, I had to ""utilize"" my membership.

Recently got a new phone and compared prices to what I was getting with membership and I was a bit taken aback, often times I don't save any money at all using memberships. The few times when I get a lower delivery fee, it's usually inflated up by some other charge and the final amount is not much lower than what I could get without a membership. If I had to sum up my purchases in the last year, I would have saved a lot more by not ordering as much, rather than trying to ""utilize"" my membership. Just realized that I was completely wrong about the membership benefits. And this is in a tier 1 city in the south, it's a bit baffling and definitely eye-opening.",india,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ky5uiz/using_zomato_gold_or_swiggy_one_doesnt_really/,LagrangeMultiplier99,315,51,0.95,,

Reddit_Comment,"I can only tell you about delhi but zomato gold has two major benefits here: 


1) you get discounts on large orders which is excellent for times when you are hosting, you get discounts every time you try a new place, you get discounts at certain restaurants that otherwise don't offer discounts, you sometimes get complimentary dishes along with your order and there's no delivery fee except for rain surcharges. This, however, is not the primary reason my friends and I use it. The primary reason we use it is in point 2. 
2) you get 10%-15% minimum discounts at restaurants that are partnered with zomato gold (and there are many, many restaurants that do this) off your total bill if you pay through zomato and have gold membership. For instance, we (3 of us) went to Vietnom in cyberhub for a meal and the bill was 13K but with zomato gold, we paid 9K.   

You might not be saving money because you don't order in too much so it makes sense for you to not have it but it really can save you a fair bit of money if you use it not only for food deliveries but also at partnered restaurants.",india,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ky5uiz/using_zomato_gold_or_swiggy_one_doesnt_really/muurs0x/,LagrangeMultiplier99,318,51,0.95,gutastic1,46

Reddit_Post,"Title: India is a great country to visit but sadly India doesn’t make the process to visit India easy. . Body: When western tourists rave about Bali, the first thought that comes to my mind is india has that…it’s called Kerala. 

When western tourists rave about visiting the beautiful mountains in Switzerland or New Zealand or Nepal, india has that too- it’s called Himachal Pradesh, ladak, and jammu. 

When western tourists rave about coffee or tea plantations in South America or Bali, well India has that as well- Darjeeling in Bengal or chikmagalur in Karnataka are just two examples. There are others I can’t think of in india. 

When American or Canadian tourists rave about how much culture there is when visiting Western Europe, I shake my head. India also has culture. Hell india is the oldest human civilization and has plenty of temples older than even the oldest churches in Europe. 

Yet in spite of what india has to offer, western people and even people from other countries immediately talk about negatives about india. They say it’s dirty, unhygienic, too crowded, too polluted, visiting india is an assault on all five of your senses etc. Part of this is because of some of India’s popular tourist attractions are well maintained but the surrounding area of these tourist attractions is horribly maintained. Go to Taj Mahal and you’ll see this firsthand. The Taj Mahal is beautiful but once walk maybe 300 meters away, you see some of the worst filth- no dust bins to throw trash, mounds of garbage on the ground, flies, dusty grounds, filthy stray dogs, hanging electrical wires in the middle of the street, half finished sidewalks with big ditches in them full of rubbish etc. And this is why so many westerners portray India in a bad light.  It’s not that all India’s places to visit are dirty. Kerala for example is much cleaner. Mysuru is cleaner. Bangalore, chennai, and Hyderabad are also much cleaner. It’s just that some of India’s most popular such as Taj Mahal and golden temple are near a lot of rubbish and dirt. You don’t see this to the same extent in many popular vacation destinations around the world that are in developing countries Eg Cancun or Istanbul or Rio de Janeiro. 

Aside from that, india does not make it easy for a foreigner to visit. One needs to get a e-visa in advance to be able to visit and the site to do this application is very out of date. Many places issue visa on arrival to tourists Eg Bali. Aside from the headache to get a visa, most Indian merchants do not allow foreigners to use international credit/debit cards and instead pay an additional fee of 1000 rupees to apply for a upi wallet. As for those who say pay with cash, a lot of merchants don’t have change so this complicates things if you don’t have upi. In most places, a foreigner can pay with cash or their international credit card. Then, a lot of places/Indian apps don’t let you use their services if you don’t have an India mobile number. Zomato and ola both don’t let you use their services if you do not have an India mobile number. Even to get wifi at an Indian airport, you need an India mobile number to receive the OTP code to be able to connect. If you don’t have an india mobile number you need to find an information kiosk and be issued a WiFi voucher where you need to fill out a form containing your personal information including your passport. In many countries, one can connect to wifi almost immediately as soon as they land in the airport of that country without needing a local phone number or filling out all your personal details Eg Bali, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Cancun, london, Paris etc. 

I hope India finds ways to simplify this process for tourists to be able to visit india as india has a lot to offer any tourist. ",india,,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hgzevp/india_is_a_great_country_to_visit_but_sadly_india/,anonymousman898,140,128,0.85,,

Reddit_Post,"Title: Having to beg for food from neighbours for survival.. Body: Hello Everyone, I'm making this post on the behalf of u/Euphoric_Subject_218, he texted me from my Zomatao AMA post to enquire about the job details. I talked to him further and got to know his gut-wrenching everyday struggles so I decided to share this with y'all and get some help. He has to collect leftovers from his neighbours to eat. He has had a very tough childhood as his dad passed away when he was only four. His mother is totally dependent on him. I'm pasting his story which I had asked him to post but it got deleted due to low Karma. 


His Text:

My current condition, options and attemts. Share your thoughts if you understand.

I'm 21, 10th fail, self dropped out of school 
because of poor survival/quality of life.

Dad passed away since i was 4, no connections, no relatives, only a mother, and she worked minimum wage housemaid jobs till i was 15, after that the people where my mom worked started helping us by giving us leftover foods 2 times like lunch and dinner,
and it became a habit for my mom, she stopped making food and working all together. and i was okay till that time, living cheap not having a nice childhood & school life, doing home chores like pani bharna, food collecting, cleaning etc.

the reason why i couldn't pursue education is doing all this home chores with poor diet and trauma that came from being the poor kid, i thought if i need something for myself i need to do job now, and i was in govt. school so most of my school life was restricted like everytime i used to do something (masti or talking ) an impolite warning came over my head that your Freeship will be cancelled.

basically it was hard, but i thought i can barely afford school, how am i gonna afford a college degree or anything plus i was 16 at that time in 2019, i thought i can do job now to have atleast average life and live a little, keep in mind that seems like a sob story / victim mindset but I'm just trying to ask something, and its easy for people to just say that do a nice job ex- 10k a month labour job and provide and be cool. I've heard this phrase my whole life, the problem is now my mother is completely dependent and if i start providing by exchanging my time for money I'll just stay in the loop and waste my youth for survival.
 
not to mention the amount of stress i had in my brain having lived this life and now i wanna get out of this and i want peace and happiness for once.

i don't wanna live my life just for food and survival i want to live.

this codependency of a family member and also doing home chores that your parent mom should do so you can focus on your career,

i don't have that privilege.

I'm not blaming, I'm finally get out of this trauma, and I'm trying to do gig jobs like zomato, blinkit, while also trying to work on myself and take care of basic home expenses.

but i have 3 goals for the future,

low maintenance job that doesn't take a toll on my health like crazy labour does.

high to moderate earning (if i earn 20k a month that'll be enough for now to improve my standard of living, like have some time and good food to eat rather than leftovers.

and some peace to see the time and living my life.

i have thought about resuming my education and starting diploma and college but I'm afraid how I'm going to pay for it, instead I'll make better use of that money in savings to buy 1 BHK own home on emi or something,

but prioritising peace over hustle and not overworking like crazy wasting time of this life for money and seeing money for what it really is, i iust need good hot food everyday, and shelter of a home.

I'm currently working minimum wage job my salary is 4k inr a month working 4 hours a day / 7 days a week. I'm not working crazy labour job like 10k inr a month cuz I can't collect the leftover food i have to collect every noon and night & do home chores while simultaneously trying ot make sense of this and be sane (it's low maintenance for me and i can do home work too) i have to do job in the neighborhood local shop, and I'm working part time to have some time on my hands, but I'll shift to this delivery jobs for they pay better and no boss over you, and basically it fits the preference. i still have a lot of work to do but i think I'll be able to. 

thank-you for reading this long and if you have spare clothes you don't use anymore you can send them to me via courier I'll appreciate your help, thankyou so much for your time and your understanding.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Why should I innovate when ONLY rent seeking rewards unlimited generational wealth?. Body: 


Too many rent seekers everywhere
Rant
1 - Get dowry, use it to buy a floor in a building.

Rent it out. Do not give receipt. Get tax free money forever with 0 initial investment. The dowry was black money.

That's the law. At time of marriage people can get unlimited money. The dowry giver claims his income is from agri.

2 - Food outlets. Write European style fonts, use adulterated food. Charge foreign prices. Pay Indian minimum wage to the worker. Pocket the margins.

Cost of cake cookies is foreign style, adulteration Indian style.

Every shop I see, the land is owned by a rent seeker which got the land via sheer luck.

3 - Water tanker, the driver is paid horrible, abused, the water is bad too.

The money is made by the rent seeker.

4 - Pre school. The worst I have seen.

The salary of the teachers is horrible. But the curriculum is eu style.

They copy the syllabus from schools in west, force the teachers to memorize and yap memorization on the kids.

The money is made by the rent seeker who owns the school. He is probably a graduate with political connections but charges 3l per year and pockets all the margins.

5 - Packaging startups like mama e f cry simply eat doc on call ye mam urban bark..

All of these have horrible pay, no pf, no insurance, nothing for the girls and boys doing the work.

But the money charged for so called ease is pocketed to the rent seeker mba graduate who is an idea guy who promises to loot the public via ipo.

You are literally giving away 3 times your money for the ease of hair cut at your flat.

Here is how - idea guy from mba gets money from his seniors, hires coders,makes them work 15 hours a week. Then he uses the workers to do the on ground work.

He is looking for daily active users, so that he can put in ppt of his seniors fromiitttmm.

But that's not the whole story. He files for an ipo at 100x valuation.

You being a fool buy his ipo and make the rent seekers even richer.

But again that's not the whole story.

Even if you don't buy the ipo, your sip, your lic, your pms, buys whose companies at ipo.

The 1% of monthly sip of 5000 crores was used to buy junk like papa ear f cry paytm zomato and will be used to buy junk like ola yes mam bom ather whole food.

None of the IITisans or IIMs ceos are BUILDERS. REPEAT IT. They are packaging guys.

Want a solution?

Stop giving in peer pressure. In a captalism driven world, you do not budge in peer pressure.

The SIP, hotels, builders, guys take your money and teach you demand supply.

When you question, they become commie gaslithers like "" 1% of sip means nothing "", 13% rent increase is market rate.

Reddit_Post,"Title: I don’t know why people aren’t aware of this – The White T-Shirt Movement deserves more attention.. Body: Just came across whitetshirt.in, and honestly, I’m surprised it’s not being talked about more.

It’s a youth-led initiative in India aiming to bring back decency, compassion, and ethics into public life and politics. They’re not just ranting online—they’re actually organizing grassroots programs like “Kaam ke Bande,” which helps platform workers (think Swiggy/Zomato delivery partners, cab drivers, etc.) get politically organized and have a voice.

The whole idea is based on five simple but powerful principles: compassion, unity, non-violence, equality, and progress for all. It feels like something straight out of the old-school freedom movement vibes but made for today’s India.

I think people are so jaded by toxic news and politics that they miss when something genuinely good shows up. Not trying to promote—just genuinely impressed and hoping more people look into it.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Failed in life. Body: Hello I'm 23M I haven't achieved anything in my life so far I feel like a complete loser. So, my story is that after completing 10th grade, I pursued a diploma. During that time, I was interested in photo editing and used to watch a lot of YouTube channels related to photo editing. Later, I also created my own channel and uploaded several videos, but I didn't get much response, and I'm getting backlogs because I wasn't focusing on my studies. So I distance myself from youtube for a while but eventually ended up quitting youtube.

""But still, I wasn't able to clear my backlogs and failed. Then COVID came, and online exams were conducted, because of which i cleared all my backlogs. After completing diploma, I got admission into engineering in 2nd year .At that time I'm also looking for some work so that I'll be able to pay my college fees so I looked into part-time work and found out about delivery jobs. Through a friend's reference, I got a job as a delivery boy with Amazon. During that time, my engineering studies were also ongoing, but I only went to college for practicals and exams because I had told the college about my job.The exams were MCQs, so there wasn't much stress about studying. I used to go to work in the morning and return home by afternoon, then worked in  second shift in the evening. This routine continued for two years. After that, my Amazon job ended due to some issues, and i & 2-3 more got fired. A few months later, I got to know about zomato and i  started working there as a delivery boy I used to work in evening and besides that I was also looking for some online earning source then I got to know about forex trading.

Engineering final year was also approaching, and offline exams were about to start, but I was very distant from my studies. I took tuition classes and attempted the exams, but couldn't clear them. After that, in the last semester, I filled out the exam form, and during that time, my trading addiction was super high I spent day and night on trading while working part-time with Zomato. The money I earned from Zomato was spent on trading, and I didn’t focus on studies at all. Two years passed by this way, even though I had given myself one year to focus on trading. If it worked out, fine otherwise I would complete my studies. But I didn't take any action regarding my studies. Now, I have a loss of 1.2 lakhs in trading, no savings, and I'm in debt also. My friends are doing much much better then me in life, but I haven't achieved anything. I am still stuck as a delivery boy. I want to get out of all these I want to complete my studies i don't want to these delivery boy job anymore it sucks but I think it's too late now. I haven't had any professional job or internship to date, and I don't have any skills literally, I don't know anything. My parents say that when someone asks them what their son do they feel ashamed about what to say I feel so depressed I'm introvert female interaction is 0 in my life neither I'm into sports or any physical activity. My hairs are falling & i procrastinate too much I'm a complete failure in life😭. I want to build my career but don't know which path too choose. Any suggestions/advice would be appreciated.

Reddit_Comment,">my trading addiction

**It feels like an addiction because** **you're no longer trading but gambling** and you also mention that you're making a lot of losses. You should face facts and ask your friends / family / professional help (if you think you cannot do this on your own) that you are struggling with this and that you need to stop. Uninstall all of your trading apps and face that fact that you're not going to make money there atleast right now when you have said you don't know how the whole thing works.

Instead of getting your feet wet in 100 things, do things step by step. Ideally I think your goals should look something like the following

* **Your degree**. - This should be your priority no matter what. People say degrees don't matter much and what not and it is semi-true. But if you need interviews at good companies you NEED a degree to get them to consider you in the first place. So make this your MOST IMPORTANT GOAL right now and protect it. Nothing should stop you from writing your exams, study everyday diligently and finish them and get that piece of paper
* **Getting a job -** I assume you have a good gap in your career right now and that would mean not a lot of companies will see you as first preference. So start off with jobs that have a low barrier to entry obviously the pay is going to be low as well but you need to start somewhere to gain the experience so that you can eventually move your way up. You have a few options here since you said you have an engineering background
   * **NON CS engineering (assuming you're non CS)** - If you are non CS and want to get into core engineering, you have the option to write govt exams to get an engineering job but know that that would mean you studying and prepping more. Some people have it in them to study more some people don't. I don't know which one you are but either way BE HONEST to yourself if you can do this or not that way you don't waste your own time. But the idea is prep for the exams get selected and then join work but personally if you ask me you say you have a lot of backlogs so I don't think you're the kind who can cope with a lot of studying
   * **CS Engineering -** If you are CS or want to get into CS then companies would definitely look at your resume and would raise question marks. So get a low tech job like a support role / call center role / something where you can work while slowly building your way to a better job by switching jobs.
   * **NON engineering jobs (bank jobs etc)** - There are always bank jobs and other similar exams that you can write but again this would involve you having to study a lot and I'm not sure if you can do it. But it is one good shot that you can try.
* **Health -** You need to be in good spirits if you want to make it. I would definitely suggest not hanging out with people who pull you down.
   * **Physical Health -** You say you are not interested in sports or physical activities, the easiest exercise I can give you is to **WALK.** Walk like a crazy man for an hour everday. It is not as intensive as other forms of exercise but it is still an exercise and beats sitting at the couch. Walk everyday and you will feel mentally fit and also physically fit. You can listen to some music / podcast while walking. And the thing about walking you need no equipment other than footwear. Walk on the road or your apartment terrace or wherever you want. Play pokemon go if you want to but the idea is keep moving
   * **Losing Hair -** Honestly I don't know why you are losing hair, it could be because its genetic or maybe your water is weird or something but you should know that going bald is not a bad thing. I have a friend who was going bald in his college and instead of worrying about it, man removed all his hair and he now looks like a badass hipster nerd and shit. So embrace the 'bad' changes that you get
   * **Mental Health -** Do not engage with people who put you down by their achievements and do not engage with people who you put you down with their collective sorrow (you know like how people in bad situations mingle with other people in bad situations on the guise of sharing sorrows but instead now give you more bad habits and don't let you escape). Get good friends, get good habits. Read a little everyday or watch a movie everyday something to give your brain a rest.

Body: [https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/national-news/odisha-introduces-menstrual-leave-for-women-employees-on-independence-day](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/national-news/odisha-introduces-menstrual-leave-for-women-employees-on-independence-day)

Published on: 15 Aug 2024, 3:42 am

BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha government has announced one-day menstrual leave for women employees working across state government and private sector. The policy unveiled by Odisha Deputy Chief Minister Pravati Parida during Independence Day celebrations in Cuttack, is effective immediately. It allows women to take leave on either first or second day of menstrual cycle. This reflects state’s commitment to supporting women’s health and well-being.

This development comes amidst ongoing national discussions about menstrual leave policies in India. Currently there is no national legislation addressing menstrual leave. However, Right of Women to Menstrual Leave and Free Access to Menstrual Health Products Bill 2022 proposes three days of paid leave for women and transwomen. This bill is still pending enactment. Supreme Court has recently urged central government to establish model policy on menstrual leave. They suggest such matters should be addressed through policy-making rather than judicial intervention.

Odisha's policy brings it in line with few other states and private companies that have adopted menstrual leave measures. Bihar and Kerala are only Indian states that have implemented menstrual leave policies so far. Bihar’s policy introduced in 1992, grants women two days of paid menstrual leave each month. Kerala in 2023, expanded its policy. It includes female students in all universities and institutions. It offers up to 60 days of maternity leave for female students over 18.

In addition, some private companies in India have also introduced menstrual leave. Zomato, for instance has been providing 10 days of paid period leave annually since 2020. Despite these advancements, there is still no comprehensive national law governing menstrual leave. Previous legislative efforts including Menstruation Benefits Bill, 2017 and Women’s Sexual Reproductive and Menstrual Rights Bill, 2018 have not passed. Odisha's new policy represents notable step forward in recognizing and addressing workplace needs of women.

Reddit_Comment,"Why does rIndia keep having this kind of post every month? I mean by this time I thought people would have already realised the obvious that Swiggy & Zomato are ripping you off & it’s no longer covid that you need to use them. I get it sometimes situations are not favourable & one needs to use them. But on regular days what will it take people to move out of their houses & actually go to a restaurant to eat?

Think it this way. In a restaurant on regular days if I order a dish, a very regular dish like Paneer Masala with Naan; it takes restaurants to serve it on my table 10 minutes, max 15 mins. The dish will be served hot & fresh straight put of kitchen. Now if I order same on these apps, the hotel will still make it ready in 10 mins, but for it to reach my home it takes 30-40 mins; assuming the restaurant is 2 kms away. Which means I am getting charged high and still getting not the freshest food I would have got in the restaurant.

Ok, now I am done eating. I pay the Rs.250 which all goes to the hotel with no cut to the app. I tip the waiter ₹10-20.

Reddit_Comment,"Not every restaurant does this though.


A very well known biryani restaurant in Kolkata charges the same at their place as on swiggy and Zomato. I know because a friend went to eat and it's the same damn price.

But since Zomato swiggy gives good discounts, the food is actually cheaper even after the extra charges.

Plus I'm not going 10-12 kms to go eat somewhere.

Plus most restaurants.in Kolkata, even the big names like the one unnamed, they don't do their own deliveries..it's all these apps",india,,https://reddit.com/r/india/comments/1gtgfo7/zomato_vs_swiggy_vs_restaurant_bill_comparison/lxr27vv/,sbqualitymaster,28,14,0.7,ProfessorGinyu,2

There is no indian tech giant in india ! If you say infosys then its service based company , i havent seen they develop anything significant or life- changing technologies ! 

And on your main question , zomato is still a delivery company who have margin from their so called under wage delivery partner , prove me wrong but zomato / swiggy will have stagnation and eventually fall bcz once consumers realise that they are gonna pay extra to make this company’s profitability everyone’s gonna dump ! People has to earn 10x to ignore their daily wage’s 10% as a food delivery  !

Plus I think with Paytm’s database. Zomato can see which restaurant are visited the most when a customer books a ticket to an event. Maybe they an make ticket dining combo of some sorts for that specific restaurant. Possibilities are endless.

Reddit_Post,"Title: India’s Investment FOMO: Why the Stock Market Can’t Compete with Binge-Watching and Food Delivery . Body: It looks like Indians have jumped on every tech trend possible: we've got 136 crore internet users, 120 crore mobile subscribers, and even 40 crore people hooked on social media. But when it comes to investing in the stock market, it's like everyone collectively mutters, ""Investing? Sounds risky. Pass me the remote instead.""

With only 8 crore stock market investors and a paltry 3.5 crore mutual fund investors, it seems the average Indian would rather swipe up on Instagram or place another order on Zomato than even think about “mutual fund Sahi hai.” And just when a few brave souls start feeling a bit curious about investing, in comes the government saying, ""Oh, by the way, we’re increasing the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax."" That’s like saying, “Come join the fun… but now it’s even pricier to stay!”

Honestly, it's no wonder potential investors are running for the hills. For the average person, investing now feels like paying extra for a concert ticket just to hear an hour-long lecture about risk before the music even starts. Why go through the trouble when you can binge a new OTT series, scroll through social media, or splurge on food delivery guilt-free?

So, India’s investment scene will keep being that quiet, awkward corner of the economy while everything else is booming with enthusiasm. Until someone invents a “Netflix for stocks” or starts delivering “Buy One, Get One Free” shares, India’s investors will remain rare, and the LTCG tax will keep them even rarer.",IndianStreetBets,,https://i.redd.it/zxzimnte8iyd1.png,SabudaanaKhichadi,660,84,0.94,,

This is such an over reaction. No one is running for the hills, even after the new taxes were announced, the monthly mf numbers were only going up. 


In 2013 Mutual funds used to have ₹7 trillion in assets, a decade later it's ₹50 trillion. 7x times increase in a decade what the fuck more do you want? 


No school or college is teaching you about investments and stock markets. We're a country that believes in gold, now people are realising and diversifying a bit but if you want the mindset of the 140cr country to change overnight, Sorry but you need to use some common sense. 


Why do you think the markets are down only 6% even after FIIs took out 1lakh crores in a month? It's cause domestic mfs have the power more to counter it.

Reddit_Post,"Title: Zomato backlash?. Body: I went to a couple of local sweet shops to buy some sweets for Diwali. I was surprised to see a huge rush (even though it's festival season but the rush was unusual).... I told the shop owner that it was nice to see business booming. He told me that business is usual but rush is mostly because he stopped delivering via Zomato as the fees are too much for him and the service isn't too great. He said he is happy to serve customers directly at cheaper rates. Something similar I heard at the other sweet shop too. I know it's anecdotal, but could this be a teaser for things to come? I never used Zomato, but I am still invested in the company.

Reddit_Comment,"Now I don’t have much knowledge about stock market but I can give you the basic reality of Zomato app these days. 

Check the menu prices of a local restuarant near to you and cross check them with the prices in Zomato for the same restaurant, you’d know the amount of price difference. On top of that there’d be all the other charges which would ultimately make the order total go up by 50% or more than the original menu prices of the restuarant. Considering this, it makes sense why people prefer going directly to the restaurant. Also Zomato’s customer service has gone to shit these days. If you’ve got any problem related to your order, you can’t get in touch with any human assistant in their chat support except an automated chat bot. Their email support is another piece of shit. I have seen like 5 or 6 posts describing negative experience with Zomato in the last 1 week.",IndianStreetBets,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1gfs6dj/zomato_backlash/lukw17k/,DilliKaLadka,471,81,0.98,Cautious_Priority_53,103
Reddit_Comment,"Yes, I have been telling about this possibility from a long time. Zomato/Swiggy business is not sustainable in the long run. Both Customers and Restaurants are unhappy about the high charges. And sooner or later they will figure out some alternative solution.

And there is no customer-loyality. It is not like a social media app where there is network effect. Here, if one friend comes across a new app that delivers for less price at his area, he will tell his friends, and they all will jump to the lowest priced option immediately. Within 2-3 months, you can takeover all the customers of a locality to your own app. 

Many such local apps are popping up too, as cost of development is less than Rs10k with ready made code available online. All you need is bunch of part-time workers, usually college students. Then, just add all restaurant of your area. No need to partner with them at all. Then sell at the same price as restaurant, plus Rs30 delivery charge. 

You will be selling at much less price than zomato/swiggy. This has been strategy of the apps I have seen. And there is no GST or any other kinda fee. Once your app is success and has users, you can get 10% from restaurant side too. Highly profitable idea, with very low investment, and zero training required for employees.

I was a regular user of both. But after the bad experiences, I now only use it in rare scenarios. I instead prefer calling restaurant and ordering directly. Most restaurants deliver. And its free delivery too. So, you eat at same price as if you were sitting in that restaurant.",IndianStreetBets,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1gfs6dj/zomato_backlash/luk1uz9/,DilliKaLadka,471,81,0.98,Fdsn,121

Reddit_Comment,"Posting in a seperate comment since a lot of people are not seeing the issue here -

One of zomato's offering with the ""hyperpure"" is that if you buy items from them, they will mark your restaurant as ""using top quality ingredients"".



That is how the ""hyperpure"" tag is marketed. - that customers can order food in peace, assuming that only top quality ingredients are being used in the food.

  
But if you start selling cheap quality ingredients in hyperpure too, it's akin to cheating your customers through deceitful marketing. not that it is illegal but highly unethical.

What happened to the profits? I guess they are going to say it does not matter and point you to adjusted crap..

For a company with a P/E of over 300, this growth does not align with the valuations.. QoQ is very poor and yoy is being helped by a very low base.

Reasons for my Prediction 

• Low price stock ... more people have access to this stock due to low price volume traded Will be high 
• Zomato going for FNO this Year .. 
• Ceo is very smart and greedy he knows how to manipulate and have very positive image. Any big or small announcement can create a positive impact
• Online food sector is growing like never as people are not going out for dinner and prefer to order it online at lower price
• One inside news I have heard...  in next 1 year they Woll split the food order business and grocery business ( blink it).

Reddit_Comment,"My Portfolio hit 1Cr today and I wanted to share this with someone anonymously.

I started investing in April 2021 and have been steadily increasing my investments. One major redemption of capital assets was done in 2023 for about 40L to put towards a down payment.

I'm 32 years old now. Total net worth should be about 1.5-1.6Cr.  
  
At one point, I had over 50 Scrips in my portfolio. Now, it has been trimmed down to 8 stocks. Three Scrips now hold a present value of over 10L.

I have investments in 13 MFs in total. It's not this large by choice.

A substantial proportion of my investments is in international funds. \~24L

These are in Navi's US Total Stock Market FoF, Navi's NASDAQ Fof, Mirae Asset NYSE FANG+ FoF and Motilal Oswal NASDAQ FoF. Only Motilal Oswal's fund allows additional investment, so I'm holding the other three even if I cannot invest more.  
Their Expense Ratios are much lower than MO's Expense Ratios.

I also have some ELSS funds which don't see any new investments given then don't help me in the new tax regime. 3-year lock-in is the reason they still exist.

Just under 4L in SGBs. 2L in Liquid Funds for short-term needs.

As I said in the title, it's been all simple investing. No F&O. Negligible Intraday. Mostly long-term holdings and sales.",IndianStreetBets,,https://reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/1hb8w6p/significant_personal_milestone_simple_consistent/m1edpzr/,MicroAlpaca,288,60,0.98,MicroAlpaca,64

I’lL DM you guys with your gift cards soon.
See you in the next one guys!


 Hey guys, just comment on this post for a chance to win a Zomato gift card worth Rs. 300. No need to compose anything special, just comment.

Sometime today (Sunday, June 29) evening I’ll pick one or more comments at random and DM them.

Also, I do this quite frequently. So preemptively answering some questions.

1. No, it’s not a scam.

2. No, I’m not affiliated with zomato in any way.

3. I’m not rich, I’m just older and have some disposable income.

4. I do donate to other charities, this is just for my reddit gang.

5. Yes, it’s truly random. I use the Google random number generator to pick comments.

6. I do it because it feels nice to be treating someone, no other reason. Not karma. I don’t earn a ton of karma from these anyway.

7. If you want to add on and also do a giveaway over here, mention it in the comments, I’ll update the description when I see it.

8. Also I do not want to send you my username as a gift heh. And on that topic, my username has no meaning apart from being funny to me. 

That’s it I guess. Best of luck, byeeee!

So yeah, what the header says. Post a comment on this thread. Sometime later in the evening (2 Feb), I’ll pick a few comments at random and DM them Zomato gift cards worth Rs. 300.

Also, preemptively answering some common questions that have been asked in the past.

It’s not a scam.

I don’t work for Zomato.

I’m not doing this for karma; you would be surprised how little karma threads like these make. 

My handle doesn’t really have any deep meaning; it’s just supposed to be gross. And was funny to me.

Yes I could donate this to charity, but I already do that; this is just for my reddit guys. 

I’m not super rich, I’m just older and have some disposable income.

I use a random number generator and pick comment numbers.

This doesn’t take a lot of time. But yeah, I try and do it on days I do have some free time.

That’s it, thanks and have fun.",indiasocial,,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1ifuwr5/hey_who_wants_a_treat_from_me_zomato_giveaway/,AnalFissureSmoothie,815,1043,0.94,,

Reddit_Post,"Title: Found metal in food ordered online 😱. Body: Ordered parotta from Ambur Star Briyani in Zomato. Found metal screw like piece in the gravy given and was just shocked. Imagine what could have happened when I swallowed it 😱😱😱

You will not order if you see the cloud kitchens. Dark and dirty. Zero hygeine. Already had a very bad experience with Fresh menu (had not just 1 but a small bundle of hair in my paneer wrap). Since this incident I have been ordering very rare that too from places that are estabilised and has a restaurant as well.

I don't want their stupid refunds. I am not ordering to make money and get free food. I don't want to die due to metal choking or get sick due to the unhygienic shit they make.

Please do eat at home as much as possible. On times when you don't feel like cooking/ have anything at home, I would say even Instant noodles are far better that what shit they cook and sell outside/ on food ordering apps.

I'm done with food ordering. Uninstalled all food delivery apps and am never going back.

He was on an automatic wheelchair. The wheelchair had 4 wheels and it wasn't run manually but with the help of a remote and there were like Christmas lights all around the wheelchair of all colours glowing and blinking to maybe drive around in traffic at night 😭😭
And he wasn't someone young, he was a well older  guy, I wanted to ask him about it further but I'm way too introvert and thought maybe he will think I'm trying to embarrass him so I kept quiet😭
Just imagine guys he is handicapped and still delivering food in a wheelchair caring and providing for his family and we cry over petty things. Respect to the man and also to zomato employing such people making sure they live a normal life just like anyone else.

This is not a scam. I can’t prove it, you just have to trust me I guess.

I don’t work for Zomato in any capacity.

I’m not particularly rich. I’m just gainfully employed.

No I don’t want to donate this to charity instead. I already do charity, this is for my Reddit fam.

I don’t do it for any particular reason, especially karma. it feels nice to treat people.

Reddit_Post,"Title: ""10 minutes early, yet begging for ratings—why are delivery partners living in fear of unfair pay cuts?"". Body: The Harsh Reality of Gig Workers
I recently ordered food via Swiggy, and what happened next shook me. The delivery uncle arrived 10-15 minutes early, handed me my order, and then pleaded:

""Ma’am, the app has a glitch—it’s not showing ‘delivered.’ Please don’t rate me poorly, or my entire day’s pay will be deducted.""

I assured him I’d never give unfair ratings, but as I waited for another order, I saw him standing there for 10 extra minutes, stressed and helpless. Why? Because companies like Swiggy, Ola, Uber, and Zomato have built systems that:
Slash earnings over minor rating glitches.
Pocket huge commissions, leaving workers with pennies.
Threaten livelihoods for being ""too fast"" or app errors.

This isn’t just a ""bad day at work""—it’s systemic exploitation.
These companies profit BILLIONS while workers beg for basic dignity.",indiasocial,,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1l5fpmu/10_minutes_early_yet_begging_for_ratingswhy_are/,Glittering-Fault-467,61,5,0.97,,

Reddit_Comment,We mistakenly got an order worth 700. The guy came the next day and we returned it. His relief was huge since he could lose a days wage if he couldn't recover it.

I’m nowhere close to that, but I’m trying not to order in too much these days.
So I’ve started making things that are easy, colourful, and quick to throw together.

This is my lunch today.
